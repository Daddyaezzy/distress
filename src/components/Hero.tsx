                The distress app is a personal safety application designed to
                quickly and discreetly alert authorities and selected contacts
                in case of an emergency. With a simple interface, the app allows
                users to send a distress signal, sharing their real-time
                location through Google Maps and an in-app map. The app is
                designed with a focus on user discretion, featuring a subtle
                design that can be easily hidden in critical situations,
                ensuring help is summoned without drawing unnecessary attention
                from potential assailants.

                The distress appâ€™s AI-driven route prediction sets us apart.
                When a distress signal is sent, our app not only shares the
                user's location but also predicts potential routes they might
                take, using real-time geographical data. This unique feature
                helps responders quickly and accurately track the user. Our
                AI-powered approach ensures that help is not just on the way but
                is on the right track, making our app a truly life-saving tool.
